# Usage

**Language:** English | [日本語](ja/usage.md)

This guide covers daily usage with the **installed common-kit `unreal` command**. (For flags on the source-built binary, see [Architecture — Native launcher](architecture.md#native-launcher).)

## Starting and Finding Sessions

A **Session** is a persistent conversation tied to a workspace (your Git worktree root, or the current directory outside Git).

1. Open Bash in your project directory and run:
   ```bash
   unreal development
   ```
2. If no Session named `development` exists yet, enter `y` to create it.
3. Later, run `unreal development` from **any directory** to reconnect to that Session.

### CLI Commands

| Command | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `unreal` | Lists existing main Sessions (newest first) so you can pick one by number |
| `unreal <name>` | Attaches to `<name>`, or offers to create it in the current workspace |
| `unreal --where <name>` | Prints the workspace directory path for Session `<name>` |
| `ucd <name>` | Changes your current Bash directory (`cd`) to Session `<name>`'s workspace |
| `unreal --workspace-info` | Prints config, state, log, and socket paths for the current workspace |
| `unreal --readme` | Displays the README bundled inside the installed kit |

> **Notes:**
> - Running bare `unreal` without a name only lists existing Sessions; it never creates a new one.
> - If the same Session name exists in multiple workspaces, the current workspace takes precedence; otherwise Unreal prompts you to pick by number.
> - Advanced flags `--instance` and `--config` target an explicit operator instance in the current workspace and bypass global Session lookup.

## Working in the Terminal (TUI)

### Basic Workflow

1. **Slash commands:** Type `/` to open the command menu. Use `Up`/`Down` to navigate, `Tab` to autocomplete, and `Enter` to select.
2. **Choose model & permissions:**
   - `/model` — Switch provider (`Claude` or `Codex`), model, and reasoning effort.
   - `/permissions` — Switch between `Read Only`, `Ask for Approval`, and `Full Access`.
3. **Send tasks:** Type your message and press `Enter`.
4. **Navigate:** Use `Page Up` / `Page Down` (or mouse wheel) to scroll history. Run `/help` at any time to view commands and shortcuts.

### Views (`/view`)

- **Split (default on terminals ≥120 columns):** Shows **Chat** on the left and the **Work pane** (live main/child agent cards) on the right. Automatically switches to Chat if you narrow the window below 120 columns.
- **Chat:** Focuses on the conversation. On wide screens (≥120 columns), active child cards still appear on the right; on narrower screens, a compact 1-line child dock appears above the input bar.
- **Orchestration:** Uses the full main area to display agent cards and progress beads. Scroll with `Page Up` / `Page Down`.

### Footer Gauges

The bottom bar displays three live metrics (`—` when unknown):
- **Context (`文脈`):** Current input token usage and percentage of the model's context window.
- **Speed (`速度`):** Output generation speed in `tok/s`. A `~` prefix indicates client-clock timing (used for Claude). Tool execution and approval wait times are excluded.
- **Cache (`キャッシュ`):** Prompt cache hit rate for the latest turn.

## Keyboard Shortcuts & Text Input

| Key / Action | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Send message or run slash command |
| `Ctrl+Enter`, `Shift+Enter`, `Alt+Enter`, or `Ctrl+J` | Insert a newline (if supported by your terminal) |
| `\` at end of line + `Enter` | Insert a newline (works in all terminals) |
| `@` | Search and insert workspace file paths |
| `Ctrl+A` | Select all text in the input box |
| Type / Paste while selected | Replace selected text |
| `Backspace` / `Delete` while selected | Clear selected text |
| `Esc` or Arrow keys | Clear selection |
| `Home` / `End` | Move to start / end of input (or top / bottom of chat when input is empty) |
| `Page Up` / `Page Down` | Scroll conversation or Orchestration cards |
| `Ctrl+D` | Detach from TUI (Session keeps running in the background) |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel pending submission wait; otherwise stop the Session |

### Pasting and File Drop

- **Multiline paste:** Long pastes collapse into `[Pasted text #1 +N lines]` in the input box and never auto-submit until you press `Enter`.
- **Windows Sandbox file drop:** You can copy [`scripts/windows/sandbox-drop.cmd`](../scripts/windows/sandbox-drop.cmd) into your Windows `SendTo` folder and rename it to `<sandbox-name>.cmd` (e.g., `development.cmd`). Dropping files onto it copies them into `/home/agent/drop/` inside the Sandbox and places their paths on your clipboard.

---

## Copying and Exporting Conversations

### Copy to Clipboard (`/copy`)

- `/copy` — Opens an interactive message picker. Use `Up`/`Down` to move, `Space` to toggle multiple messages, and `Enter` to copy.
- `/copy last` — Copies the latest public agent response.
- `/copy all` — Copies the entire public conversation as Markdown.

> **Note:** `/copy` uses the OSC 52 terminal escape sequence. If your terminal or multiplexer (`tmux`/`ssh`) blocks OSC 52 clipboard writes, use `/export` instead.

### Export to Markdown File (`/export`)

- `/export` — Opens a menu to export the **Latest response**, **Full conversation**, or **Choose a response**.
- Direct shortcuts: `/export last`, `/export all`, `/export pick`.
- Files are written to `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/unreal-agent/exports` and the exact path is printed in the TUI.

Both `/copy` and `/export` read from the complete canonical history (even messages scrolled off-screen) and omit internal reasoning, compaction markers, and routine background child traffic.

## Stopping, Detaching, and Resuming

### Stopping Work (`/stop`)

Running `/stop` opens a menu with four scopes (**Main agent** is focused by default):

| Option | Shortcut Command | What It Stops |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sub-agents** | `/stop sub` | Cancels all running child agents; main agent continues |
| **Main agent** | `/stop main` | Interrupts the main agent's current turn; children continue |
| **Main agent and sub-agents** | `/stop main+sub` | Interrupts the main agent and cancels all children |
| **Session** | `/stop session` | Stops the entire Session (resume later with `/resume`) |

### Detaching and Resuming

- **Detach (`Ctrl+D` or `/detach`):** Closes the terminal UI while the Session continues running in the background.
- **Resume (`/resume` or `unreal <name>`):** Resumes a stopped Session and restores your last selected permission mode. If the previous provider is unavailable, switch providers with `/model` first and then run `/resume`.
- **Retry (`/retry`):** If a message submission fails or times out with an uncertain state, `/retry` safely resends it using the original submission ID so it is never duplicated.

## Delegated Background Work (Child Agents)

When using Claude, the main agent can delegate implementation or research tasks to background GPT sub-agents (such as `lead`, `worker-*`, and `collector`).

- **Automatic wake-up:** When a child finishes or reports back, it wakes the parent agent automatically without requiring user input.
- **Compact chat display:** Routine parent-child coordination is folded into a single summary line (`┄ 裏の作業 ...`).
- **Important notices stay visible:** Agent messages starting with `【報告】` (Report) or `【要確認】` (Needs Confirmation) are always shown in full, and `【要確認】` highlights a banner above the input bar until you reply.
- **Approvals:** Child tool requests follow the parent Session's permission mode and are mediated by the parent agent. See [Providers — Delegated GPT work](providers.md#delegated-gpt-work) and [Permissions](permissions.md).
