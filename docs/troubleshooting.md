# Troubleshooting

**Language:** English | [日本語](ja/troubleshooting.md)

## Login Required or Expired

If you see `auth required`, `external_reauth_required`, `OAuth session expired`, or `OAuth token has expired`, the active provider's external login needs to be refreshed. Unreal never switches providers automatically or falls back to an API key.

### How to Fix

1. **Refresh the login in the same Linux environment where Unreal runs:**
   - **Claude:** Open a Bash shell, run `claude`, and execute `/login` inside Claude Code. *(In a Docker Sandbox on Windows, you can run `sbx exec -it <sandbox> claude`.)*
   - **Codex (Standard):** Run `codex login` in Bash.
   - **Codex (Docker Sandbox OAuth):** Repair the host OAuth login (`sbx secret set openai --oauth`) and Sandbox proxy route. See [Providers](providers.md#docker-sandboxes-codex-oauth).
2. **Reload the provider in Unreal:** Return to Unreal and run `/model refresh` (or select the provider in `/model`).
3. **Resume if stopped:** If the Session stopped due to the error, run `/resume`.

> **Note:** Signing in on your Windows/macOS host does not automatically sign in a Linux WSL environment or Docker Sandbox unless you are using configured Docker Sandbox OAuth forwarding. Also note that `/login` inside Unreal only displays sign-in instructions; actual authentication always happens in `claude` or `codex`.

## Startup or Command Lookup Fails

If `unreal` does not start or points to the wrong command:

1. **Check command resolution and workspace paths in Bash:**
   ```bash
   type -a unreal claude codex
   "$HOME/.local/bin/unreal" --workspace-info
   ```
2. **Fix `PATH` or command shadowing:**
   If another alias or binary shadows `unreal`, either invoke `"$HOME/.local/bin/unreal"` directly or reload the shell setup:
   ```bash
   . "$HOME/.config/unreal-agent-common/path.sh"
   ```
3. **Create a named Session first:**
   Running bare `unreal` only lists existing Sessions. To create your first Session in a project, specify a name:
   ```bash
   unreal development
   ```
4. **Verify binaries and system libraries:**
   From the extracted kit directory, run `bash doctor.sh` to verify binary checksums and glibc compatibility.

> **Tip:** `unreal --workspace-info` inspects the **current directory's** workspace. To inspect a Session located in another project, run `ucd <session-name>` first, then run `unreal --workspace-info`. Do not delete or overwrite config/session files manually to clear a workspace mismatch error.

## Models Are Missing or Out of Date

1. Confirm that the external CLI (`claude` or `codex`) is installed and signed in.
2. **For standard Codex OAuth:** If `models_cache.json` is missing on a fresh install, start the `codex` CLI once so it populates its local model cache.
3. Run `/model refresh` inside Unreal to re-probe provider availability and model catalogs.

> **Notes:**
> - In Docker Sandbox Codex OAuth mode, if a live `codex app-server` catalog query fails or times out, Unreal retains the last successful cached catalog (`~/.cache/unreal-agent/codex-cli-catalog.json`).
> - A model appearing in the catalog does not guarantee that your subscription tier has entitlement to run it.

## Reconnecting, Resuming, and Retrying

1. **Reconnect after `Ctrl+D` or disconnect:** Run `unreal <name>` (e.g., `unreal development`). The TUI rebuilds the view from canonical history.
2. **Resume a stopped Session:** Run `/resume` inside the TUI (or reopen with `unreal <name>`). If the previous provider is unavailable, switch providers with `/model` first, then run `/resume`.
3. **Resend an uncertain message (`/retry`):** If a network or socket hiccup left a submission in an uncertain state, run `/retry`. It reuses the exact submission ID so your prompt is never duplicated.
4. **Session locked by another process (`writer_owned`):** Close the other terminal/process that owns the Session and reconnect. Never delete lock files or live Session files manually.

> **Note:** If a background Host restarts, any unfinished child agents are marked canceled and reported to the parent agent rather than respawned automatically.

## Finding Logs and State Files

Run `unreal --workspace-info` inside your project to print the exact directories for that workspace.

For the common kit, files are stored under:
- **Workspace configs:** `~/.config/unreal-agent-common/repos/`
- **Workspace state & logs:** `~/.local/state/unreal-agent-common/` (contains `host.log` and `sessions/`)
- **Launcher settings:** `~/.config/unreal-agent-common/launcher.json`

Check `host.log` around the timestamp of any failure.

> **Warning:** Files inside `sessions/` are your canonical conversation records, not temporary debug logs—do not delete them. When reporting bugs, never share raw credential files or private session transcripts.

## Read analysis and measurements

Run `/analyze` in the TUI to inspect detailed Session diagnostics and token accounting.

1. Run `/analyze` to open the view picker.
2. Select a view (`Enter` or `Esc` returns to the picker).
3. Select **Export** to save the analysis report as JSON or Markdown (or use `/export all` for the full conversation with statistics).

### `/analyze` Views

| View | What It Shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Overview** | Active provider/model, response & tool counts, elapsed time, and Host commit/build metadata |
| **Usage** | Input tokens, cached input tokens, reasoning/output tokens, and Claude turn-total observations |
| **Turns** | Per-turn provider, model, effort, and token usage |
| **Tools** | Tool operation outcomes and Claude Bash hook durations (`native_bash`) |
| **Agents** | Child agents, final statuses, and `child_start` template/model/effort records |
| **Context** | Context window size, average input tokens, pruned tool results, estimated token savings, prune boundaries, and Claude compaction events |
| **Timeline** | Chronological event log and activity durations |
| **Errors** | Recorded errors and redacted provider diagnostics |

### How Metrics Are Calculated

- **Cache percentage:** `cached_input / input` across reported usage.
- **Footer context vs. Average input:** The TUI footer shows the **latest request's** context size (not the sum of a multi-step tool loop). Average input in `/analyze` averages across all reported model calls (including summarization calls).
- **Generation speed (`tok/s`):** Calculated from reported output tokens and generation time. A `~` prefix indicates client-clock timing. Claude Bash elapsed time measures from the pre-tool hook to completion.
- **Claude turn-total usage:** Already included in response totals—do not add it a second time.
- **Unknown vs. Zero:** If a provider does not report token usage, Unreal displays it as **unknown** (`—`), never as `0`. Labels like `partial/incomplete history` or `resync` indicate that statistics reflect only the observed portion of history.
